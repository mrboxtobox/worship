1 Father, I know that all my life
is portioned out for me;
the changes that are sure to come
I do not fear to see:
I ask thee for a present mind,
intent on pleasing thee.
2 I would not have the restless will
that hurries to and fro,
seeking for some great thing to do
or secret thing to know;
I would be treated as a child,
and guided where to go.
3 I ask thee for the daily strength,
to none that ask denied,
a mind to blend with outward life,
while keeping at thy side,
content to fill a little space,
if thou be glorified.
4 In service which thy will appoints
there are no bonds for me;
my secret heart is taught the truth
that makes thy children free;
a life of self-renouncing love
is one of liberty.
