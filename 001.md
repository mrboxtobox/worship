## Scripture: Hebrews 12:1–2

> Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. (ESV)

1. By all your saints still striving, for all Your saints at rest, \
Your holy Name, O Jesus for ever more be blessed. \
You rose, our King victorious, that they might bear the crown \
And ever shine in splendor, reflected from Your throne.

2. Apostles, prophets, martyrs, and all the noble throng \
Who wear the spotless raiment and raise the ceaseless song: \
For them and those whose witness is only known to You – \
By walking in their footsteps we give You praise anew.

3. Then let us praise the Father and worship God the Son, \
And sing to God the Spirit, eternal Three in One, \
‘Til all the ransomed number who stand before the throne \
Ascribe all power and glory and praise to God alone.
